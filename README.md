# Fantasia

This is my personal website which you can find at [andredavcev.com](https://andredavcev.com/). Fantasia comes from one of my favorite movies as a kid [The Neverending Story](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_NeverEnding_Story_(film)>). Over the years this project should evolve and become my creative outlet.

## Technology Stack

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) using [Nrwl Nx](https://nrwl.io/nx). Every push to the master branch triggers continuous integration using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). This Angular application is currently on version 14 and utilizes various TypeScript libraries. [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) is used extensively throughout the code and am using [NGXS](https://ngxs.gitbook.io/ngxs) for state management.

## Quick Start & Documentation

Although this is a personal project, you should be able to replicate my environment quite easily. Simply clone my repository `git clone https://github.com/andre-davcev/sandbox.git` and then run `npm i` inside the repository folder (assuming you have npm installed globally).

## Running Fantasia locally

Run `npm run fan-serve`. Then navigate to [localhost:4201](http://localhost:4201/). Enjoy!

## Thanks for checking out my code!
